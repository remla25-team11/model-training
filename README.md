# Model Training

This repository contains the code used to train our sentiment classification model.

The training logic is organized into modular scripts using a DVC pipeline:
- `prepare_data.py` â€“ cleans and vectorizes the input
- `train_model.py` â€“ trains and saves the classifier
- `evaluate_model.py` â€“ evaluates performance and logs metrics

## ðŸ“¦ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## DVC Remote Setup (Google Drive via Custom Google Cloud Project)

This project uses Google Drive as a DVC remote to store and share datasets and trained models using a custom Google Cloud OAuth application.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install DVC with Google Drive support:**

   ```bash
   pip install "dvc[gdrive]"
    ```

2. Place client_secrets.json (shared privately) into:

    ```bash
    .dvc/client_secrets.json
    ```

3. Configure the remote

    ```bash
    dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://<your-folder-id>
    dvc remote modify myremote gdrive_use_service_account false
    dvc remote modify myremote gdrive_client_id <your-client-id>
    dvc remote modify myremote gdrive_client_secret <your-client-secret>

    ```

4. Pull shared data and models:

    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```

5. Push updates to remote:

    ```bash
    dvc push
    ```
