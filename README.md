# Model Training

This repository contains the code used to train our sentiment classification model.  
The training logic is implemented in the `main.py` file.

## Install dependencies

Start by installing the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Usage

To train the model, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The latest trained version of the model is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/remla25-team11/model-training/releases) section of this repository.

You do not need to retrain the model unless you are making changes to the training logic or dataset.
